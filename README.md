A timer for 'work time' and 'rest time' for utilizing the 'Pomodoro Technique'.
Made as part of The Odin Project's curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project?ref=lnav

This was originally intended as a pair-programming project but due to time constraints was completed as a solo project

Possible future implementations: a 'continuous mode', different color scheme?
